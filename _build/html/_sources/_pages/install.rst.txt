Prerequisites
"""""""""""""

#. Install WP-CLI http://wp-cli.org/#installing
#. Install global packages from NPM: ``npm install -g foreman yarn`` [1]_ [2]_
#. WordPress installed and configured as per `official documentation`_

.. _official documentation: https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress

.. note::
    We don't know if you have a local apache {M,L,W}AMPP or whatever in order to
    do the official installation process. Keep in mind that Wordless flow
    do not need any external web server, since it will use `wp server`_ command
    to serve your wordpress

.. _wp server: https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/server/

.. seealso::
    :ref:`Server`

Steps
"""""

.. note::
    We consider that you have WordPress already up and running and you are in
    project's root within your terminal.

#. Install and activate the wordpress plugin

    .. code-block:: bash

        wp plugin install --activate wordless

#. Scaffold a new theme

    .. code-block:: bash

        wp wordless theme create mybrandnewtheme

#. Enter in theme's directory

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd wp-content/themes/mybrandnewtheme

#. Bundle NPM's packages

    .. code-block:: bash

        yarn install

#. Start the server - and the magic

    .. code-block:: bash

        yarn run server

Webpack, php server and your browser will automatically come up and serve
your needs :)

.. seealso::
    :ref:`Server`

.. note::
    It's possible that your OS will ask you to allow connections on server's
    ports (3000 and/or 8080). It's just ok to do it.
